# Image2Ascii

This project converts images into ASCII art, transforming visual elements into text-based representations that retain the image's recognizable shapes and contrasts. This can be useful for generating creative visual representations that are compatible with plain-text environments or for producing stylized artwork.

## Features

- **Image to ASCII Conversion**: Converts standard image files (e.g., JPEG, PNG) into ASCII characters.
- **Customizable Output**: Adjust the ASCII character set, resolution, and other parameters for personalized results.
- **File Export**: Save generated ASCII art to a text file.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install any necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/baruhifraimov/Image2Ascii.git
cd Image2Ascii
```

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Additional dependencies can be installed via `requirements.txt` (if applicable):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. Run the script with the desired image file as input:

   ```bash
   python image2ascii.py path/to/image.jpg
   ```

2. (Optional) Adjust output settings such as character density, scale, or output file path.

## Example

Here's a quick example of converting an image:

```bash
python image2ascii.py sample.jpg
```

This command will generate ASCII art based on `sample.jpg` and display it in the console (or save to file if specified).
